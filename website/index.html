								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My name is <b>Amando Ruiz</b> and I've been working within the Technology field for the past <u>FIVE (5)</u> years. Before making my way into technology, I've spent a good amount of time as a Geek Squad Agent for a local Best Buy. My tenure as a Geek Squad Agent not only honed my customer service skills but also provided me with valuable hands-on experience in troubleshooting hardware issues. During this time, I cultivated a keen ability to address customer needs promptly and effectively, contributing to my overall proficiency in providing technical support. I've then ventured into the tech field, after the closing of my Best Buy store, finding an opportunity as a "Service Desk Technician" in 2018.</p>
								<p>My first opportunity in tech was that of a help desk role within the Third Party Logistics (3PL) market. Since then I've had several title changes including "Onboarding Specialist", "Level 2 Technician", and my current title of "Technology Asset Management Associate". Embarking on my tech journey, I've continuously acquired diverse skills in previously unfamiliar technologies, including: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>Azure Active Directory</li>
										<li>ServiceNow</li>
										<li>JAMF</li>
										<li>Microsoft Intune - Endpoint Management</li>
										<li>Amazon Web Services</li>
									</ul>
								<p>With a career advancement goal in mind, I've set a target in June 2023 to master 'The Cloud' through proficiency in Amazon Web Services (AWS). After a few months of dedicated self-study, I successfully earned the foundational certification as an 'AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner' (screenshot above). Currently, I am honing my skills and striving to achieve the 'Solutions Architect Associate' certification. </p>

								<p>Cultivating my expanding collection is a beloved hobby, encompassing diverse genres such as non-fiction, fiction, graphic novels, and manga. While I'm open to collecting any book, my recent focus has been on self-help and science fiction.</p>
								<p>Listed below are the latest books and manga that have recently entered my collection:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><em>"The Book of Mistakes"</em> by <u>Skip Prichard</u></li>
									<li><em>"The Others"</em> by <u>Jeremy Robinson</u></li>
									<li><em>"My Hero Academia Vol. 35"</em> by <u>Kohei Horikoshi</u></li>
									<li><em>"Fire Force Vol. 24"</em> by <u>Atsushi Ohkubo</u></li>
								</ul>
								<p>My second hobby involves the construction and modification of <b>mechanical keyboards</b> in various shapes and sizes. A recent project of mine focused on restoring a recycled Redragon  Ten Key-Less keyboard. The endeavor commenced with a meticulous cleaning of both the external case and internal components. Subsequently, I opted to enhance the user experience by replacing the originally noisy switches with a quieter MX Cherry option. As I delve into building and modifying mechanical keyboards, each project becomes a satisfying endeavor. Whether restoring a Redragon TKL or creating one from scratch, the joy lies in crafting a uniquely customized keyboard.</p>

							<p>After achieving the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification, I reached out to a Cloud Engineer at my workplace. They warmly welcomed me and, upon learning about my certification, recommended taking on the Cloud Resume Challenge to enhance my portfolio. This opportunity not only introduced a new challenge but also granted access to our environment's cloud sandbox, allowing me to work with AWS services without affecting our Production environment. Prior to taking on this challenge, my background was primarily theoretical, lacking significant hands-on experience in the cloud. However, I was undeterred by my limited cloud exposure and eagerly embraced the challenge.</p>
							<h3>First part: Certification and Skill Building</h3>
							<p>Unknowingly inaugurating the challenge, I secured the Foundational certification by passing the $100 exam on August 6th, 2023. Subsequently, I leveraged my knowledge from an introductory coding class in my Senior year of High School to undertake the hands-on task of crafting a resume using HTML and CSS. While I'm not a coding professional, I've utilized the example code provided in the challenge as a temporary placeholder while working through the 16 steps. I updated the code after verifying the successful execution of all other steps, which is reflected in the current version.</p>
							<h3>Second part: Deployment and Security</h3>
							<p>The next phase involves deploying the HTML resume as a static website using an Amazon S3 bucket. Following that, the resume is secured with HTTPS through Amazon CloudFront. This entails creating a CloudFront distribution linked to the S3 bucket and establishing a custom DNS domain directed to the CloudFront distribution</p>
							<p>Hosting objects through an S3 bucket proved straightforward, but challenges arose when transitioning the static website to a secured CloudFront distribution. While linking the distribution to an object is simple, ensuring robust security requires additional steps. Opting for extra security, I created an S3 bucket policy, disabling the static website setting and enabling CloudFront access. This essentially limits access to the objects in my S3 bucket to the CloudFront distribution. The next hurdle involved creating a custom DNS domain and registering an SSL certificate. After overcoming multiple attempts and adjusting registration settings to DNS, I successfully registered my domain. Moving forward, the journey faced additional challenges in the realm of coding.</p>
							<h3>Third part: Development and Functionality</h3>
							<p>The third part emphasizes building a visitor counter using JavaScript, storing the count in a DynamoDB table. This involves crafting a Lambda function written in Python to manage and display the current visitor count on the static website.</p>
							<p>This phase proved to be the most time-consuming, given my limited knowledge of Javascript, Python, and databases. Initially delving into Javascript through various YouTube tutorials, I faced a misdirection in the project. Following extensive self-study on Javascript, I then invested time in basic Python learning from Udemy courses. Despite consuming copious YouTube and Udemy content, my initial coding attempts ended in failure. It wasn't until I leveraged a ChatGPT account that I discovered critical logic issues, particularly related to case sensitivity in variables. After a weekend of debugging and refining, I successfully integrated a visitor counter into my JS code, along with a Lambda function in the correct Python language. This refined code executed the Lambda function, interacting with my DynamoDB table and updating the visit count on my website. Despite being the most challenging step, the satisfaction of seeing my website counter transition from displaying 'Website Counter' to the actual visit count made it immensely rewarding.</p>
							<h3>Fourth part: Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)</h3>
							<p>The fourth section addresses establishing GitHub repositories for both backend and website code, incorporating CI/CD via GitHub Actions for enhanced workflow efficiency. Ensuring security, this step emphasizes refraining from committing AWS credentials to source control.</p>
							<p>While seemingly straightforward, this step not only provided valuable insights into GitHub repositories and Actions but also reshaped my understanding of code deployment, emphasizing the efficiency and security achieved through automation. It dispelled the notion of manual updates within developers' IDEs, highlighting the importance of streamlined processes in the workplace.</p>
							<h3>Fifth part: infrastructure Management</h3>
							<p>The last step involves defining resources in an AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) template for Infrastructure as Code, and I've opted to execute this using Terraform.</p>
							<p>My familiarity with this step was limited to hearing the name 'Terraform' in conversations with a Network engineer at work. Initially leaving it as my final step, despite being less proficient in VS Code (Terraform), I gained exposure to Terraform's functionalities for creating and deploying pipelines. As I bring the Cloud Resume Challenge to a close, I am inspired to continue my Terraform education, recognizing its significance in my workplace infrastructure. My goal is to elevate my skills and become a valuable asset to the Cloud team. Throughout this journey, having a Cloud Engineer mentor has been invaluable, providing guidance and steering me in the right direction at every obstacle. I look forward to applying the knowledge gained and contributing effectively to our cloud projects in the future.</p>
